    Download GA test
</h1>
<p>
    This is a test of GA tracking. There is a link to a <a id="click-me" href="http://google.com"
        title="My external link" class="samewindow" data-event-type="event">external resource</a>.
    It does not have to exist, just be clickable. Even if it is opening in the same
    window, it is treated as an external link</p>
